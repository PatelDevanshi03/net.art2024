      <p style="font-size:20px; font-family:times new roman; color:rgb(136, 230, 244); background-color:rgb(4, 57, 214);">The online exhibition "Beyond Boundaries: The Digital Architecture of Human Connection" delves into the creative spirit of net art, showcasing works that challenge traditional notions of space, communication, and the relationship between humans and technology. Here, the real and the virtual come together to invite viewers to explore through carefully selected pieces. The chosen works, which cover a number of decades, offer an interesting discussion on the transformative potential of digital media.</p> 
      <p style="font-size:20px; font-family:times new roman; color:rgb(173, 242, 157); background-color:rgb(3, 111, 23);">This exhibition examines at how, in the digital era, net art creates new relationships. Robert Adrian's 1982 feature "THE WORLD IN 24 HOURS" breaks down geographical borders by connecting audiences worldwide through live communication. Through real-time video conferencing, "MOBILE IMAGE" (1975 - Ongoing) by Kit Galloway, Sherrie Rabinowitz, and Collaborators crosses boundaries of space and promotes a feeling of global community. Last but not least, Jon Rafman's "NINE EYES OF GOOGLE STREET VIEW" (2008 - Ongoing) blurs the boundaries between virtual and real by using digital pictures to link viewers to actual areas. Despite their varied approaches, these pieces all demonstrate how net art has the ability to create new connections and transform our perception of the world.</p>
      <p style="font-size:20px; font-family:times new roman; color:rgb(247, 185, 255); background-color:rgb(178, 7, 124);">Even though each piece of art takes a different approach to connecting, they are all fascinated by the possibilities that technology presents.Â "THE WORLD IN 24 HOURS" serves as both a historical landmark and a window into a future in which global communication in real time becomes the norm. With a more interactive style, "MOBILE IMAGE" encourages viewers to actively participate and form connections over great distances. By using the digital eye to see the unexpected beauty and secret stories concealed inside our real world, "NINE EYES OF GOOGLE STREET VIEW" takes a more mindful approach. When taken as a whole, these pieces create a powerful portrait of the changing terrain of connection in the digital age, where real and virtual environments merge and technology serves as a means to promote fresh forms of communication and understanding between people.</p>
