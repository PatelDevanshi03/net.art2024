      <p style="font-size:20px; font-family:times new roman; color:rgb(136, 230, 244); background-color:rgb(4, 57, 214);">The online exhibition "Beyond Boundaries: The Digital Architecture of Human Connection" delves into the creative spirit of net art, showcasing works that challenge traditional notions of space, communication, and the relationship between humans and technology. Here, the real and the virtual come together to invite viewers to explore through carefully selected pieces. The chosen works, which cover a number of decades, offer an interesting discussion on the transformative potential of digital media.</p> 
      <p style="font-size:20px; font-family:times new roman; color:rgb(173, 242, 157); background-color:rgb(3, 111, 23);">The exhibition features works by Galloway, Rabinowitz, and collaborators that demonstrate the power of technology to connect us beyond physical barriers. These works include "STARRYNIGHT" (1999), a user-friendly interface that democratizes access to celestial exploration, and "MOBILE IMAGE" (1975 - Ongoing), an interactive piece that uses communication to move past historical and geographic boundaries. Last but not least, Adrian's ground-breaking live show "THE WORLD IN 24 HOURS" (1982), which featured global happenings, predicted the globalized society we currently live in.</p>
      <p style="font-size:20px; font-family:times new roman; color:rgb(247, 185, 255); background-color:rgb(178, 7, 124);">These works all center around the same idea, which is how connections are evolving in the digital age, although taking different approaches to the subject. "STARRYNIGHT" and "THE WORLD IN 24 HOURS" both demonstrate how digital technology may transcend physical location; although the latter gives a global experience, the former enables virtual exploration. By exploring the ways in which interactivity enhances communication across large distances, the idea of "MOBILE IMAGE" is expanded. When considered collectively, these pieces demonstrate how net art can be a powerful tool for reconsidering both domestic and global relationships.</p>
