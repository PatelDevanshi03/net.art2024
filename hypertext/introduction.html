    <h2> What is stress? </h2>
  <p style="font-family:Georgia;"> Stress is the body's and mind's reaction to things or circumstances that endanger our health. It is the body's response to any form of pressure or expectation. <br> Numerous factors, including job, relationships, money troubles, or traumatic experiences, can cause stress. Stress physiologically causes chemicals </br> like cortisol to be released, raising blood pressure and heart rate. Long-term stress can cause anxiety, depression, and heart problems, among other health problems. <br>Concentration problems, memory problems, and unfavorable thought patterns are examples of its effects. Excessive or sustained stress is harmful, whereas moderate stress might improve performance.</br> <br>But <b>NO WORRIES!!</b> Its effects can be minimized and general well-being can be increased by coping mechanisms like exercise, mindfulness, and social support.</br></p>
